			 	<h1>Hack Reactor Week 5</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Fri, Nov 6, 2015</span>
			      

<p>With another week completed, week 5 has been extremely interesting. The topics this week included authentication, and deployment, along with introductions to MongoDB and Angular.</p>

<h4 id="authentication">Authentication</h4>

<p>As we all know, security is a pivotal part of development. Authentication is the act of verifying that your user is actually who they say they are. This verification normally includes a username and password. When that password is passed to the server we then return a token for return authentication requests.</p>

<h4 id="deployment">Deployment</h4>

<p>Learning deployment has been very fun, and I have really enjoyed leveraging services like <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> to make deployment easy as possible. Along with deployment, we talked about using build task runners such as Grunt and Gulp.</p>

<h4 id="angular">Angular</h4>

<p>Angular is an excellent framework that I was able to work with at the end of the week. Unlike Backbone, Angular is quite opinionated, in a good way. Angular has thorough documentation, and has promises built in, to handle callbacks.</p>

<p>With only one more sprint next week, the transition to group project phase begins!</p>
