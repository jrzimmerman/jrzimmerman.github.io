      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am excited to have been one of the lucky few to get in to the Remote Prep class for Hack Reactor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to blogging about the content that is discussed on a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you get in to the Remote Prep class?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-1/&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Week 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-2/&#34;&gt;Week 2&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-3/&#34;&gt;Week 3&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-4/&#34;&gt;Week 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am fortunate enough to be in the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackreactor.com&#34;&gt;Hack Reactor&lt;/a&gt; Remote Prep class! It is 4 weeks long, meeting 5 days a week for 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class time has flown by, and I have been able to work and get to know a majority of my classmates! I had wondered what it would be like to pair program remotely with people, and I honestly think it is just as good as if the person was sitting beside you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first week was spent learning Markdown, HTML, and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first night was a &amp;lsquo;get to know the class&amp;rsquo; where each person &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/jrzimmerman/4bc55dd20ae8206689c0&#34;&gt;interviewed their paired partner&lt;/a&gt; and then had to introduce their partner to the class. We styled the information with Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;html&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second night focused on learning HTML and &lt;a href=&#34;http://jzimmerman.divshot.io/&#34;&gt;deploying our first site&lt;/a&gt;! This was a great experience. Since I knew some HTML already, the instructors hinted at using Bootstrap to style the site. I was also able to use the command line to deploy my website using &lt;a href=&#34;https://divshot.com/&#34;&gt;Divshot&lt;/a&gt;. One of the cool things about the Remote Prep class, is that the instructor and TAs are always willing to push you when you ask for extra material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;css&#34;&gt;CSS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third night was more difficult for me. I am probably the least exposed to CSS, and I was able to learn so much from the exercises. We also focused on importing media to websites such as YouTube videos, Google Maps, sound files, and external sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;forms&#34;&gt;Forms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth night was all about styling multi-page web sites and learning how to use forms in HTML. We also discussed GET and POST, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc&#34;&gt;how the internet works.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;css-frameworks&#34;&gt;CSS Frameworks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth day was all about advanced styling of layouts with CSS and an introduction to modern HTML and CSS frameworks! I am excited to be using &lt;a href=&#34;http://minimalcss.com/&#34;&gt;MinimalCSS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://getbootstrap.com/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; from this point forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to continue posting what I have learned from class on a weekly basis! Happy learning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-1/&#34;&gt;Week 1&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-2/&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Week 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-3/&#34;&gt;Week 3&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-4/&#34;&gt;Week 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another week completed already! With the end of week 2 brings the close to the first half of the class. At the end of each class, the instructors give a survey to determine if you feel &amp;lsquo;behind pace,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;on pace,&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;ahead of pace.&amp;rsquo; While I still feel I am in the &amp;lsquo;ahead of pace&amp;rsquo; category, I have been learning quite a bit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;introduction-to-javascript&#34;&gt;Introduction to JavaScript&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the cool things about Hack Reactor is that, no matter the complexity of the material, they always find a way to challenge you with the exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day of the week was very easy, covering terminal and operators in JavaScript. This gave me an opportunity to assist students newer to these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;dom-manipulation&#34;&gt;DOM Manipulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started learning about using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. This was very interesting, as I have yet to really understand how to leverage JavaScript to manipulate the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;conditionals&#34;&gt;Conditionals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This started with a brief refresher on the Boolean data type. We then spent most of our time working on If/Else statements. I really enjoyed taking what we had previously learned about DOM Manipulation and applying conditional statements based on user input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;while-loops&#34;&gt;While Loops&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very impressed with Hack Reactor as they took a seemingly simple concept and really made students push the limits of while loops. As I would normally use for loops for a majority of my functional programming, it was interesting to see how you can really leverage while loops, such as creating a simple rock, paper, scissors game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;jquery&#34;&gt;jQuery&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While jQuery can take a little getting used to, it definitely seems like the way to go for DOM Manipulation. I really enjoyed learning about jQuery effects as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;hackathon&#34;&gt;Hackathon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a Halfway Hackathon! As a team, we were required to develop a project idea, and using all that we have learned so far, develop that idea individually in 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed working with my group to problem solve and create a really fun version of the classic &amp;lsquo;Breakout&amp;rsquo; game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jz-breakout.divshot.io&#34;&gt;My version can be found here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-1/&#34;&gt;Week 1&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-2/&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Week 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-3/&#34;&gt;Week 3&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-4/&#34;&gt;Week 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-1/&#34;&gt;Week 1&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-2/&#34;&gt;Week 2&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-3/&#34;&gt;Week 3&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-4/&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Week 4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like that, the four week course is at an end. I have really enjoyed the opportunity to learn such a large amount of material in such a short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has definitely been a great learning experience for me. If you are considering going to Hack Reactor, then this course will really show you what you&amp;rsquo;re getting in to. Also, if you are wondering if you can learn in the Hack Reactor Remote online class, the answer is yes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last week we learned the following concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ajax-json&#34;&gt;AJAX &amp;amp; JSON&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started off the week learning how to use AJAX to interact with servers behind the scenes using JavaScript without having to reload the page. This was really fun, and very powerful. We leveraged the Open Weather Map API to load local temperature information to our sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;higher-order-functions&#34;&gt;Higher Order Functions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was probably the most important day of the entire class. As we worked through rewriting higher order functions like each, map, and filter, we had 1 on 1 interviews with the instructor to determine how we were doing. This was valuable feedback, and the instructor was very helpful in pointing to the next topics I should focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;object-oriented-javascript&#34;&gt;Object Oriented Javascript&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked in to more Object manipulation today, leveraging the object data type to structure our programs, rather than functions. We learned how to create our own methods in our own objects, and introduced decorator patterns and factory patterns code structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;model-view-controller&#34;&gt;Model View Controller&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a simple MVC using factory pattern objects to leverage the Imgur API and the SoundCloud API. This was a very rewarding project where I learned quite a bit of material using both simple and complex APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;portfolio-and-hiring&#34;&gt;Portfolio and Hiring&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day consisted of learning a variety of ways to improve your online presence. These included tips and tricks on how to improve your Github and LinkedIn. We discussed the importance of an online portfolio site, and blogging about technical concepts. We also covered the basics on resumes, cover letters, applying for jobs, and how to prepare for interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-1/&#34;&gt;Week 1&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-2/&#34;&gt;Week 2&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-3/&#34;&gt;Week 3&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href = &#34;http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-4/&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Week 4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
