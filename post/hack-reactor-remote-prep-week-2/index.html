			 	<h1>Hack Reactor Remote Prep Week 2</h1>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href = "http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-1/">Week 1</a> | <a href = "http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-2/"><b>Week 2</b></a> | <a href = "http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-3/">Week 3</a> | <a href = "http://justinzimmerman.net/hack-reactor-remote-prep-week-4/">Week 4</a></p>

<p>Another week completed already! With the end of week 2 brings the close to the first half of the class. At the end of each class, the instructors give a survey to determine if you feel &lsquo;behind pace,&rsquo; &lsquo;on pace,&rsquo; or &lsquo;ahead of pace.&rsquo; While I still feel I am in the &lsquo;ahead of pace&rsquo; category, I have been learning quite a bit!</p>

<h4 id="introduction-to-javascript">Introduction to JavaScript</h4>

<p>One of the cool things about Hack Reactor is that, no matter the complexity of the material, they always find a way to challenge you with the exercises.</p>

<p>The first day of the week was very easy, covering terminal and operators in JavaScript. This gave me an opportunity to assist students newer to these concepts.</p>

<h4 id="dom-manipulation">DOM Manipulation</h4>

<p>We started learning about using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. This was very interesting, as I have yet to really understand how to leverage JavaScript to manipulate the page.</p>

<h4 id="conditionals">Conditionals</h4>

<p>This started with a brief refresher on the Boolean data type. We then spent most of our time working on If/Else statements. I really enjoyed taking what we had previously learned about DOM Manipulation and applying conditional statements based on user input.</p>

<h4 id="while-loops">While Loops</h4>

<p>I was very impressed with Hack Reactor as they took a seemingly simple concept and really made students push the limits of while loops. As I would normally use for loops for a majority of my functional programming, it was interesting to see how you can really leverage while loops, such as creating a simple rock, paper, scissors game.</p>

<h4 id="jquery">jQuery</h4>

<p>While jQuery can take a little getting used to, it definitely seems like the way to go for DOM Manipulation. I really enjoyed learning about jQuery effects as well.</p>

<h4 id="hackathon">Hackathon</h4>

<p>We had a Halfway Hackathon! As a team, we were required to develop a project idea, and using all that we have learned so far, develop that idea individually in 3 hours.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed working with my group to problem solve and create a really fun version of the classic &lsquo;Breakout&rsquo; game.</p>
