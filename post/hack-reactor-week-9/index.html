			 	<h1>Hack Reactor Week 9</h1>

<p>Week 9 is finished at Hack Reactor, and thesis projects are in full swing! While there aren&rsquo;t many things on the schedule, thesis is all about trying to build the best product in the 3 short weeks you have dedicated to it.</p>

<h3 id="thesis">Thesis</h3>

<p>To start, this is a perfect summary of life during thesis:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wJ4IcDJ.gif" alt="thesis" /></p>

<p>Have no fear, little buddy.</p>

<p>While building a product can feel this way sometimes, I am having an awesome time learning and problem solving to create the best app we can possibly produce.</p>

<p>For our thesis project, my group has decided to build upon Strava&rsquo;s extensive API. We are seriously fortunate to have such a great API to leverage for our product!</p>

<p>With that being said, heres a little bit about Bestrida.</p>

<h3 id="bestrida">Bestrida</h3>

<p>The name pays homage to Strava by also leaning upon it Swedish vocabulary. Strava is swedish for &ldquo;to strive&rdquo;, while Bestrida is swedish for &ldquo;to challenge&rdquo;. Which is exactly what our app does.</p>

<p>Bestrida will allow a user to challenge anyone they follow to a particular segment. The user will pick a person to challenge, a segment, and a date the challenge will be completed.</p>

<p>All of my friends are great to ride with, but like most cyclists, they are also always up for a short sprint through a well known Strava segment. This application will take your casual ride with friends to a whole new level.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for this week. Next week I will continue to describe Bestrida, and discuss topics learned along the way.</p>
