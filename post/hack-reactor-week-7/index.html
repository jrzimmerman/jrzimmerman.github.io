			 	<h1>Hack Reactor Week 7</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 1, 0001</span>
			      

<p>Week 7 was the first week of &ldquo;project phase&rdquo; in Hack Reactor. We will go through 6 weeks of group work to become better engineers in team environments.</p>

<h4 id="greenfield">Greenfield</h4>

<p>The term greenfield comes from the engineering world, to refer to a blank slate, a &ldquo;green field&rdquo; ready to be built upon.</p>

<p>This was my first experience working with a team of four to complete a functioning project. While I greatly enjoyed working in a team environment, there were a few hiccups that we encountered and have learned from along the way.</p>

<p>My understanding of git was taken to an entire new level. This was a great experience in to learning the intricacies of git workflow and project management.</p>

<p>My team developed <a href="http://access-app.herokuapp.com/">Access</a>. We used the MEAN stack to store and display crowd-sourced handicapped accessibility information for venues. We hope that with a little more work, this functioning product will become a way for people to easily access the information they need to go places, and live their lives.</p>

<h4 id="resume">Resume</h4>

<p>The resume sprint was one of the first experiences with Hack Reactor&rsquo;s excellent outcomes team. The outcomes team works hard to take you from a great programmer, to a hirable programmer.</p>

<p>While at first glance,most people do not consider a resume to be worth taking multiple days of a course, but its actually quite the opposite. A resume, as I am sure most of you know, is the first thing a recruiter or hiring manager will see. What is a less common for people to understand, is much like the cover letter, you should write your resume with the position in mind.</p>

<p>One of the hardest parts of writing an effective resume, is not writing every accomplishment down. Every single line in your resume should announce to the reader, that you are a qualified software engineer.</p>

<p>While you might have had several accomplishments in your previous profession, if they do not directly show how great a programmer you are or how you are able to get things done, those achievements should be omitted.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! Time for a relaxing solo week, and onward to week 8 and legacy projects!</p>
