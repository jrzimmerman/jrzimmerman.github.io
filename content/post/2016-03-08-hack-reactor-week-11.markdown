With our product, Bestrida, to MVP (Minimum Viable Product) we will continue to improve our MVP features, as well as the look and feel of product, for the remainder of the week.

####Design

Our product finally received a much needed design overhaul, and we are definitely happy with the result:

#### Stretch Goals

As you can see in the above image, we are able to pull from the Strava API segment effort data for the user to view additional metrics on how well they performed during their effort.

#### Final Thesis Presentations

It's very hard to boil down three weeks of work into a simple 3 minute presentation, but fortunately I was paired with not only incredible developers, but excellent communicators. You can find our presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw_mcAhgQo4).

Only one more week until class is over! Onward to hiring week.
